# Coding Interview Tips

- Speak through your thought process!

- What are the big ideas of the problem?

    - Data structures, algorithms, special characteristics of the data

    - Ask clarifying questions!

- What is the time/space complexity of the solution?

- What about alternative solutions?

    - What are the trade-offs, or how is it worse?
    
    - Recursive vs. iterative

# Patterns

## Dictionary (Hash Map)

- Can be used as a cache

## Stack

- Good when you need to keep track of "last seen"/"history" order

## Linked Lists

- Do we need to keep a reference to a sentinel node?

    - Recall the sentinel node points to the head of the linked list
